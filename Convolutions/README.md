# Introduction Discrete Convolutions

### **Terminology**:
**Homogeneity:** If we change the strength of the input by some
factor, the output will also change by that factor.

**Additivity:** If $y_1 = T[x_1(t)]$ and $y_2 = T[x_2(t)]$ then
$T[x_1(t) + x_2(t)] = T[x_1(t)] + T[x_2(t)] = y_1 + y_2$
Where $x(t)$ is the input signal, $y(t)$ is the output signal and $T[]$ is the system.

**Time invariant systems:** A system for which a temporal shift in the
input sequence produces a corresponding shift in the output.

**Linear time-invariant systems (LTI):** Can be represented by the response of the system 
to a unit pulse. This response is called the impulse response function of the system.
