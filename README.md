This repository contains the Pyhton code and Jupyter Noteooks used to develop all the my medium posts on data analytics and all the techinques used in this field. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific post on my medium profile. 

As of March 22nd, 2024 the only posts available on Medium are the theoretical and practical implementations of Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Maximum Likelikhood and Non-Linear Least Squares for modelling data.
